# T0r0nb0 ?

This project is intented to be a simple implementation of a password cracker in C#.

With this, you can make dictionnary attack on any md5 hash you'll provide in `Program.cs`. Obviously this is not intended to be a go to for Pentest but just a small project that allowed me to work a little bit more with C# on a fun project !

# What's in there ?

You'll find different things in this repo:
- `t0r0nb0.csproj` & `t0r0nb0.sln`, necessary files if you're using Visual Studio...
- `Program.cs` -> Like the name state, main file of the project, calling functions and handling some logic
- `helpers.cs` -> Helpers file, storing generic functions
    
# Building / Running the project 
You can install `dotnet` if it's not already done and you should be good to go to build the project by just browsing into the folder you just cloned and using `dotnet build` for example.

If you just want to try it out quickly you could also just use `dotnet run`!
